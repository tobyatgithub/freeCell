# freeCell

## Introduction
### Goal
In this project, we aim to use flask to code out and deploy a FreeCell game for my grandpa, who needs it working properly and also are large enough to see (also can do fullscreen.)

## How to run

## Note

- OK... streamlit is not ideal for this use case. Trying flask instead.
